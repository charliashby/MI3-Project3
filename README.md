# MI3-Project3

## Section 1: Software and Platform
Software: Python <br />
Packages used: MatPlotLib, Pandas, PyTorch <br />
Platform: Mac & Rivanna HPC <br />

## Section 2: Map of Documentation
The repository contains a README file (this file), a LICENSE.md file, and three folders: SCRIPTS, DATA, OUTPUT <br />


### DATA Folder

Data_Appendix.pdf: includes a data dictionary as well as figures and other descriptive statistics  <br />

Data_Collection.pdf: includes instructions on how to access the data sets and prepare them to be read into the analysis scripts 

### SCRIPTS Folder

DS_4002_Proj3_ImageAnalysis.ipynb: includes all code use to preprocess, analyze, and visualize results

### OUTPUT Folder

30epochs: Accuracy of the model on test data when trained on 30 epochs at 0.0001 learning rate.  <br />
50epochs: Accuracy of the model on test data when trained on 50 epochs at 0.001 learning rate. 

## Section 3: Reproduction 
1. Follow directions from Data Collection.pdf from the DATA folder to download and properly rename the image dataset <br />
2. Download DS_4002_Proj3_ImageAnalysis.ipynb from the SCRIPTS folder <br />
3. Open the script notebook on the python code execution environment of your choice. It is recommended to run the code on a high performance computer to save time. <br />
4. Change the filepath in the notebook to match where the image folder is stored. <br />
5. Run the script. <br />
